# 📘 **Namaste DSA – Warm Up Module**

## **Class 01: Programming 101**

> *By Akshay Saini*

---

## 🎯 **Purpose of This Module**

From this point onward:

* We **start coding**
* Theory is kept **minimal**
* Focus is on **hands-on practice**

This module is designed for:

* Absolute beginners
* People with zero coding background
* Anyone who feels “coding is hard”

> This follows the **ABCC principle — Anybody Can Code**.

---

## 🧠 **What Is Programming? (In Simple Words)**

Programming means:

> You write instructions → Computer follows them → You get an output

That’s it.

Example:

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

* You wrote a command
* The computer printed something
* Programming happened ✅

---

## 🧪 **Where to Practice**

You can practice all examples here:

🔗 **Namaste Dev Playground**
👉 [https://namastedev.com/playground](https://namastedev.com/playground)

No setup. No installation. Just code.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Your First Program – Hello World**

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

* `console.log` prints output
* `"Hello World"` is a **string**
* This confirms your environment is working

---

## 📦 **Types of Data in JavaScript**

Programs work with **data**.

### 1️⃣ String

Text data

```js
"Hello"
"My name is Akshay"
```

---

### 2️⃣ Number

Numeric values

```js
10
3.14
-25
```

---

### 3️⃣ Boolean

True or false values

```js
true
false
```

---

## 🧠 **Variables – Storing Data**

Variables store data so we can reuse it.

### `const` – Constant (cannot change)

```js
const name = "Akshay";
```

### `let` – Changeable value

```js
let age = 25;
age = 26;
```

> Use `const` by default.
> Use `let` only when value needs to change.

---

## ➕ **Mathematical Operations (Arithmetic Operators)**

Programming can do math:

```js
10 + 5   // Addition
10 - 5   // Subtraction
10 * 5   // Multiplication
10 / 5   // Division
```

Example:

```js
let a = 10;
let b = 20;

console.log(a + b);
```

---

## 🔗 **String Concatenation**

Joining strings and variables together.

```js
const name = "Akshay";
const age = 25;

console.log("My name is " + name + " and my age is " + age);
```

This helps in:

* Displaying messages
* Printing dynamic output

---

## ⚙️ **How JavaScript Runs Code**

JavaScript is an **interpreted language**.

This means:

* Code runs **line by line**
* From top to bottom
* In the order you write it

```js
console.log("Line 1");
console.log("Line 2");
console.log("Line 3");
```

Output comes in the same order.

---

## 📚 **Arrays – Storing Data in a List**

Arrays store multiple values together.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Example:

```js
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
console.log(fruits);
```

Use arrays when:

* You have a collection of similar data

---

## 🧱 **Objects – Key Value Data**

Objects store data in **key : value** format.

```js
const user = {
  name: "Akshay",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
};
```

Objects are used when:

* Data has meaning
* Values are related

---

## 🧠 **Key Takeaways**

* Programming = input → logic → output
* JavaScript is beginner-friendly
* Data types: string, number, boolean
* Variables store data
* Arrays store lists
* Objects store structured data
* Practice is more important than theory

---

## ✍️ **Action Items**

* ✅ Run all examples in playground
* ✍️ Write your own Hello World
* 🧪 Create your own variables
* 📦 Make one array and one object

---

✨ **Anybody Can Code.
Start small.
Stay consistent.** 🚀
